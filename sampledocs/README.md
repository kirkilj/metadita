# Sample DITA documents

These documents are not intented as examples of good DITA markup or organization. Instead, they
are intended to test specific aspects of DITA or DITA-OT processing.

I've been asked _why_ I'm creating these. So far, as of June 1 2016, each test serves two purposes:
 1. Demostration set for a particular feature. The original set (NLS) can be used to demonstrate every language supported in the toolkit. 
The bookmap set demonstrates how every defined piece of bookmap is formatted in a PDF.
 2. Feature testing with DITA-OT. The NLS set can be used to test that every language works + 
that every variable defined for English is also defined for every other language. 
If you heavily customize styles or variables, you could use these as a starting point to test
whether those customizations work for any other language you need.

## Updates

May 2017: NLS tests moved to a new repository so they can more easily be used independently:
