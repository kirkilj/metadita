   <reason>This is a message from my Java based plug-in.
It's useless, basically, but shows that my code was added to the CLASSPATH.
A more useful class might modify my topics in some way, or report
something worth knowing about.</reason>
   <response>Remove the plug-in to remove the message.
Or change it quite a lot to do something more useful.</response>
