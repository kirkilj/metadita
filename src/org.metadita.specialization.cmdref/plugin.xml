     This is the plugin file that controls integration into the toolkit.
     Each item in the plugin that extends a toolkit function must be listed
     here. The only critical component is the catalog file, which must 
     extend the Toolkit's catalog in order for your files to be processed.

     If nothing else is overridden, then the toolkit will use fallback processing.
     This plugin file demonstrates how to imbed an override for XHTML formatting,
     so that not every element will use fallback processing.

     Be sure to change the plugin ID to use your own specialization name, rather than
     music.
