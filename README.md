Sample plugins and potentially other tools for the DITA Open Toolkit. 

Initially created with copies of sample plugins I created in December 2011,
as part of a presentation to the Boston DITA User Group on how to create
plugins to the DITA Open Toolkit. I expect to use this repository to
bring the plug-ins up to date (ensuring they work with the latest toolkit
builds), and to add new sample plug-ins to make use of extension points
added since that presentation, as well as for extension points added
in the future.
